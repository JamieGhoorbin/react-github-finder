# react-github-finder
> ### A simple React app using the GitHub API that enables you to search for users and view their profiles.

I would like to credit Brad Traversy for his tutorial course -React Front To Back- on Udemy.

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://jdg23-dev.github.io/react-github-finder

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

Local web server will use the standard React's port 3000
